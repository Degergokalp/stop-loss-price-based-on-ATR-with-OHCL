# stop-loss-price-based-on-ATR-with-OHCL
This repository contains a Python script that implements an automated stop-loss strategy for trading using the Average True Range (ATR) indicator. The strategy calculates the ATR of a given period and multiplies it by a user-defined multiplier to determine the stop-loss level for each trade.
